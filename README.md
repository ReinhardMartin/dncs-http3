# Performance evaluation of HTTP/3 + QUIC
The goal of this project is to build a virtualized framework to compare the performance of HTTP/3 + QUIC with respect to HTTP/2 and TCP.                          
To do this we used Vagrant and Virtualbox in order to manage the virtual machines and Docker to run the web-server.
